# Genre_Classification

This code was written to work with the fma small dataset. you can download the dataset here: https://github.com/mdeff/fma

- The code in CreateSpectrograms.py converts the dataset to spectrograms and saves it to a local drive.

- build_and_reain.py has three methods. One for creating train test and validation datasets, one for concatinating the datasets and one for building and training the models. They are to be executed in separate runs.
